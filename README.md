"Hello,

I'm Mohanasundar p,
      a passionate and aspiring full-stack Java developer with a strong foundation in core Java and a keen interest in modern web development technologies. As a recent graduate,
      I am excited to embark on my journey in the dynamic world of software development.

      My journey began with a solid understanding of core Java, where I learned the principles of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms.
      Building on this foundation, I delved into the realm of web development, mastering HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for creating visually appealing and responsive user interfaces.
      My proficiency in JavaScript enables me to add interactivity and enhance the user experience on web applications.

      In addition to front-end development, I have gained expertise in back-end development.
      I have worked extensively with Java frameworks such as Spring Boot and MVC, which allowed me to create robust and scalable web applications. 
      Leveraging Hibernate, I have managed relational databases efficiently, enhancing my ability to design and optimize data-driven applications.
